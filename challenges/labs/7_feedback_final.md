## Describe the boot camp

This week was extremely useful for me. Classroom basically 'runs on rails', and I don't
get many chances to work in the field, unless there are problems with already-built
clusters.

The security piece was excellent. This is one area I haven't tried out before, and I
found it suprisingly easy.

In short - time very well spent.

## Which topic was least familiar to you?

I had never done anything with Kerberos before. I've got students who ask about
security all the time, and I wish there was more about the actual "how to" in the
class. I'll certainly be referring them to the excellent blog post that we got to
use for this.

## Which topic was not useful?

Everything was relevant as far as I'm concerned.

## How long before you are ready to install a production cluster?

I'll be reviewing everything from this week for a bit. I believe I can install a working
cluster at this time, but there are a few things I want to pursue that were mentioned in
class first.

I suspect I won't actually get to do an install until our company gets another request
from one of our customers.

I will certainly use everything I've learned this week to enhance the way I teach the
Cloudera Admin class.

## What do you need to work on?

Security. Integrating other Hadoop environment apps, like SPARK, into this mix.

## Thanks so much

The week started out with a realization that what I know isn't entirely what I should
know. That alone was worth a week of class time.
